# Skycast / Aleksi Pynnönen 
Evaluated by Juliana Pääkkönen

## Usability
The app is easy to use and UI is simple and it doesn't display unnecessary information. Navigation bar is nice and I like that current weather and upcoming weather are on two separate tabs. Upcoming weather view is scrollable but swiping down also refreshes the view. This makes scrolling a bit tricky because sometimes it scrolls and sometimes refreshes. Settings are saved which is great! All in all the app is quite simple and that makes it very pleasant to use. 

## Features
The app is not very complex but weather apps rarely are. All of the features work and Skycast gives me the information I need. 

## Code
Code is easy to read and it's well sectioned. Line length is quite long here and there but it doesn't bother me too much. Code is indented and variables are clearly named. 

## Documentation
README covers everything it should. Code is commented thoroughly so it's easy to know what each function etc. does. Good job here as well.

## Grade requirements
In reference to requirements for grade 5:
- App is published to Google Play
- User experience is great
- App is complete and code is clean
- Documentation is excellent
